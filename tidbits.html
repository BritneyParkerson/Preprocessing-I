                <h3>About who I am</h3><p>Born in Adel, GA and raised in Seale, AL, I am a southern woman with big dreams.
                    I've been through many things in life but I refuse to let it define who I am like it did for many years.
                    I have broken the chains of the past and I am embracing life as it comes, while creating a better future 
                    for myself and my family (which includes my husband, our 2 kids, and our furbabies)..		
                </p>

                <h3>Present</h3><p>Currently I am running my own tech corporation and looking to expand 
                    to a new site back home in Alabama. I will be hiring a fair share of

                <h3>Future</h3><p> As my company expands I continue to work hard to run it while still keeping up with a few loyal clients
                    that I have earned over the years. Within the next 5 years I plan to have nationwide remote opportunities for employment 
                    within my company.
